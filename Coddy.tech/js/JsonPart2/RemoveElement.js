// Create a function named analyzeFriendGroups 
// that takes two arrays of names (representing two different friend groups) 
// as parameters. The function should convert the arrays to sets and returns 
// an object containing the following information (in this exact order):

// mutualFriends: The number of people who are in both friend groups
// exclusiveToFirst: The number of people who are only in the first group
// exclusiveToSecond: The number of people who are only in the second group
// potentialConnections: The number of unique connections that could be made between exclusive members of each group 
// isSubset: Boolean indicating if one group is entirely contained within the other
